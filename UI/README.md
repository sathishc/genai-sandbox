# Amazon Bedrock Agent Chatbot - Single Page Application

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.5.

## Configuration and local development
The frontend application by default downloads the configuration from the `/api/config` endpoint during the bootstrap process.

If you would like to override this configuration to use locally hosted APIs, please have a look at [config.service.ts](/UI/src/app/services/config.service.ts).


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
